The Hacking Project Week 4

I've programmed 4 little fight games in Ruby<br>
app = 2 bot players fighting until death<br>
app_2 = 1 user player fighting against 2 bot players<br>
app_3 = 1 user player fighting against 4 bot players<br>
app_3_bonus = user player fighting against infinite number of bot players. The goal is to kill the maximum of bot players.

Have a GOOD GAME !
